# Plot Model Performance Comparison

Create visualizations to compare the performance of two models based on
their performance metrics generated by
[mrIMLperformance](https://github.com/nickfountainjones/mrIML/reference/mrIMLperformance.md).

## Usage

``` r
mrPerformancePlot(
  ModelPerf1 = NULL,
  ModelPerf2 = NULL,
  mode = "classification"
)
```

## Arguments

- ModelPerf1, ModelPerf2:

  Two data frames of model performance metrics to compare. The data
  frames are created by
  [mrIMLperformance](https://github.com/nickfountainjones/mrIML/reference/mrIMLperformance.md),
  see **Examples**.

- mode:

  A character string describing the mode of the models. Should be either
  "regression" or "classification". The default is "classification".

## Value

A list containing:

- `$performance_plot`: A box plot of model performance metrics.

- `$performance_diff_plot`: A bar plot of the differences in performance
  metrics.

- `$performance_diff_df`: A data frame in wide format containing model
  performance metrics and their differences.

## Examples

``` r
MR_perf_rf <-  mrIML::mrIML_bird_parasites_RF %>%
  mrIMLperformance()
MR_perf_lm <- mrIML::mrIML_bird_parasites_LM%>%
  mrIMLperformance()

perf_comp <- mrPerformancePlot(
  ModelPerf1 = MR_perf_rf,
  ModelPerf2 = MR_perf_lm
)
```
