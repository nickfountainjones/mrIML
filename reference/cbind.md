A cbind variation that ignores objects with zero dimention

## Usage

``` r
cbind(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  (generalized) vectors or matrices. These can be given as named
  arguments. Other R objects may be coerced as appropriate, or S4
  methods may be used: see sections ‘Details’ and ‘Value’. (For the
  "data.frame" method of cbind these can be further arguments to
  data.frame such as stringsAsFactors.)
