#' @format A data frame with 171 columns (each column is a SNP) and 19 rows (each row is a sampled bobcat). The columns represent SNPs and the rows represent individual bobcats.
#' @details The dataset includes presence/absence data from one locus across 19 bobcats from the envelope gene. Each column represents a single SNP, and each row corresponds to a bobcat.
